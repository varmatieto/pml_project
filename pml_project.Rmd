### Background
Quantified Self devices are becoming more and more common, and are able to collect a large amount of data about people and their personal health activities. The focus of this project is to utilize some sample data on the quality of certain exercises to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

### Analysis
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.    
This analysis will build a machine learning model from the sample data to predict the manner in which the exercise was performed. This is a classification problem into discrete categories,  located in the 'classe' variable.  More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).     


The main objectives of this project are as follows:   
    * Build a prediction model using the most relevant features as predictors.   
    * Calculate cross-validation and the out of sample error.   
    * Use the model to predict 20 different test cases provided.    

### Load and Preprocess
The analysis starts by downloading the data into local files. There are 2 data sets, the training dataset (to predict the manner in which they did the exercise) and the testing dataset (to perform the predictions from the final model on). 

```{r download,echo=TRUE}

library(caret, quietly=TRUE)

url_train <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv'
url_test <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv'

if (!file.exists('~/GitHub/pml_project/data/data_train.csv')) {
  download.file(url = url_train, destfile = 'data_train.csv')}

if (!file.exists('~/GitHub/pml_project/data/data_test.csv')) {
  download.file(url = url_test, destfile = 'data_test.csv')  }

pml_train <- read.csv(file = '~/GitHub/pml_project/data/data_train.csv',
                      na.strings = c('NA','#DIV/0!',''))
pml_submit <- read.csv(file = '~/GitHub/pml_project/data/data_test.csv',
                     na.strings = c('NA','#DIV/0!',''))

# dim(pml_submit)
p0<-dim(pml_train)[2] # 19622   160

# colnames are identical except "problem_id" and "classe"
ct<-colnames(pml_submit)
cd<-colnames(pml_train)
my1<-ct[!(ct%in%cd)]
my2<-cd[!(cd%in%ct)]

# there are several variables full of NA
colna<-colSums(is.na(pml_train))
colnat<-colSums(is.na(pml_train))
# hist (colna); hist (colnat)
colna0<-colSums(is.na(pml_train)) == 0
colna20<-colSums(is.na(pml_train)) == 20

p1<-sum (!colna0)
p2<-sum (colna0)
p3<-colnames(pml_train)[colna0][1:7]
```


The two dataset have identical variables, except "classe" (in training ) and "problem_id" (in testing ).     
The data contains **`r p0`** variables as a whole. Checking, I see that many variables are full of NA. Actually,  there are **`r p1`** variables full of NA and only **`r p2`** variables that can be taking as predictors. I subset the downloaded dataset (both train and testing) with only relevants predictors.    
Moreover I remove the first 7 variables, (*`r p3`*) that contains *metadata* not pertinent to the prediction model.  


Before fitting a model, it is useful to have an idea of the ratio that should be expected of the outcome **classe**, with a plot distribution. The plot shows that the distribution of the outcome in five different classes is balanced. This helps both model for accuracy and overall out of sample error.

```{r plot1, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7}


features <- colnames(pml_submit[colna0])[8:59]

data <- pml_train[,c(features,"classe")]
submit <- pml_submit[,c(features,"problem_id")]

plot(data$classe,col=rainbow(5),main = "`classe` frequency plot")

```


### Data partitioning

First I partition the "Training"" dataset (already cleaned) into training and validation datasets for building the model and be ready for cross validation.


```{r seed, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}

set.seed(2204)
inTrain = createDataPartition(data$classe, p = 0.75, list = F)
training = data[inTrain,]
validating = data[-inTrain,]


```

### Model building

After a preliminary analysis (not reported here), I have chosen to run a Random Forest model. The random forest method reduces overfitting and is good for nonlinear features. 
An attempt has been made to see the importance of the different predictors in order to understand if I have to reduce the number of variables.

```{r importance, echo=TRUE,  fig.width=7}

library (randomForest)
set.seed(4543)
data.rf <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = training,
                          keep.forest=FALSE, importance=TRUE)
myimportance<-importance(data.rf, type=1)
p4<-summary(myimportance)
# colnames(data)[sort (myimportance)]
plot (sort (myimportance),col="red", pch=21, 
      main="Predictors importance", ylab=" ")

```

The plot shows that the importance of the different predictors ranges this way:  *`r p4`* .         Standing this distribution, I decide to run the model with **all** the 52 predictors.

```{r model, echo=TRUE,  cache=TRUE}

model_all <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, 
                   method = "rf", 
                   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 
                                            number = 4, 
                                            allowParallel = TRUE))
model_all$finalModel

```

The model seems to fit very well. The out-of-bag (OOB) error estimate is .59 very low indeed. 

### Model cross validation and out of sample error 

Here follows the **in sample accuracy** (which is the prediction accuracy of the model on the training dataset) and **out sample accuracy** (which is the prediction accuracy of the model on the validation dataset).

```{r validation, echo=TRUE,  cache=TRUE}

confusionMatrix(training$classe, model_all$finalModel$predicted )

#  out of sample error to be estimated
confusionMatrix(validating$classe,predict(model_all,validating))

```
 Both accuracies are over 99%. The model well fit the prediction.

### Prediction Assignment

Here, I apply the machine learning algorithm I built above, to the testing dataset provided.      
Considering that the test sample size is 20 and accuracy rate of the model is well above 99%, I expect that none of the test samples will be mis-classified.


```{r answer, echo=TRUE}

answers <- predict(model_all, submit)
answers <- as.character(answers)
answers

```


```{r writing_file, echo=FALSE}

pml_write_files = function(x) {
    n = length(x)
    for (i in 1:n) {
        filename = paste0("~/GitHub/pml_project/answer/","problem_id_", i, ".txt")
        write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, 
            col.names = FALSE)
    }
}

pml_write_files(answers)

```
